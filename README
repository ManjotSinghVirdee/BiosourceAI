## **Project**
\textit{Description:}  
This project focuses on leveraging AI-powered Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize the field of genetics and personalized healthcare. By integrating domain-specific training and fine-tuning, the solution aims to create a centralized platform that enables:

- Automated processing and analysis of genetic data from microarrays and next-generation sequencing.
- Conversational AI for translating complex genomic data into meaningful insights.
- A physician-centric tool for generating tailored, accurate, and actionable genetic reports.

The project is designed to address the fragmented nature of the current genetics/genomics industry by consolidating data and insights from multiple sources into a unified, customer-friendly ecosystem. It will allow individuals to explore and understand their genetic makeup while enabling healthcare providers to make data-driven decisions effectively.

## **Currently Working On**
1. **Model Development:**
   - Training an LLM on comprehensive datasets, including SNP information from Ensembl API, NCBI dbSNP, dbGENE, and ClinVar.
   - Implementing conversational fine-tuning using DECODE methodology.
   - Engineering prompts for structured, accurate, and conversational reporting.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - Developing pipelines to process array data and next-generation sequencing outputs.
   - Automating the generation of detailed variant reports.

3. **Feature Design:**
   - Building a search feature for physicians to query specific variants or patient-specific data.
   - Creating a user-friendly interface to facilitate data exploration and report generation.

4. **Integration and Validation:**
   - Establishing interoperability with third-party genetic testing services (e.g., 23andMe, Ancestry).
   - Ensuring accuracy through robust validation against known datasets.
